# Introduction
Quick-and-dirty extension to add color to priorities cells in Redmine query
results.

List/colors can be customized by editing *prioritiesList* array. It includes
the default Spanish/English priorities in a fresh Redmine installation.

Note: this code only works in https://*/redmine/ URL.

# Build
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/soukron/color-redmine-priorities.git
$ cd color-redmine-priorities
$ rake build
```

# Improvements
Some ideas:
 - Firefox support
 - Multiple languages support
 - Configuration page to add Redmine URL
 - Configuration page to add/remove/customize list items and colors
